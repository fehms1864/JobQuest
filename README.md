## About This Project 
This project was created to targets users who are currently looking for their next big job opportunity regardless of whether they are currently employed or not! This app is designed to store a record of all job applications and update their status so that a user might have a one stop place to inventory their past applications or update them rather than maintaining an Excel file which can be tedious.

## Tech Stack
- React
- Node / NPM
- Bootstrap
- LESS
- Javascript
- Express
- Mongodb & Mongoose


## Development 
We are a team of 2 developers working on creating a fully functional site that targets the following functionality and features:
- a live, responsive and secure https site
- a login authentication page
- a main landing home page
- an add job app record page
- filtering functionality of existing records on the landing home page

All developers contributed and pushed changes to the main github branch

The goal is to always have customer ready code in main from which the site will operate.

## How to set up locally
In order to run the application locally, please start the server and client side separately.
The only pre-requisite you need before starting locally is have mongodb installed on you machine. Mongodb Compass is a good UI app to install
as well to view the collections and documents.

### Client side
- cd client
- npm install
- npm start

### Server side
- In a separate terminal run "brew services start mongodb-community"
- go into the project directory and  go into the server folder by "cd server"
- npm install
- npm start
